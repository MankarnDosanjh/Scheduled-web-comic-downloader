This app sucks I made it public because my buddy wanted to see it so please don't send me crypto job offers by virtue of the code on display.
I'll deploy a roflcopter in case of rule breaches.

If you want to run it you need to install the following modules:
https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/ (A HTML parsing module)
https://pypi.org/project/requests/ (A module that makes downloading webpages easy)
