This app sucks I made it public because my buddy wanted to see it so please don't send me crypto job offers by virtue of the code on display.
I'll deploy a roflcopter in case of rule breaches.

If you want to run it you need to install the following modules:
https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/ (A HTML parsing module)
https://pypi.org/project/requests/ (A module that makes downloading webpages easy)

The python scripts currently attempt to download all comics from a single webcomic. Each script downloads a different comic. It will save those comics in a folder in the same location as the script. If there are errors it will write them out to a file in the same location as the script.
