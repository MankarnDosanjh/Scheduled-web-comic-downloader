# Usage

This program will download web comics and store them in a folder. This folder will be located in the same place as the Python script, and will be titled based on whichever webcomic is stored inside.

If there are any errors during a comic download, they will be written out to a file saved in the same location as the script, with a URL for the comic that failed to download.

"[comic]_downloader.py" downloads that particular webcomic. "modulisation_attempt.py" is an attempt to merge all individual comic downloaders into one.

It is better to run it in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. It also uses multithreading for speed, however you can view downloaded comics while the program runs by opening the folder generated by the script.
