HOST = Host website

CSS = CSS selector used to locate image urls

page = Host website with path and index for scraping comics.

The main function will need to take a range for multithreading.

Main function could take:
- site str : CSS selectors str dict
- Iteration range list e.g. [0, 2] or [2014, 2015]
    NOTE: Dates could work, I just need to find out how to work with datetimes like normal ranges.

Iterate through the data structure as single item, pass item to threading function,
break item into parts and pass to downloader function.
